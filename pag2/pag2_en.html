                    <p>	Shrek, the green ogre, lives a secluded life in the swamp and enjoys his solitude. 
						But behind his rough-and-tumble fa√ßade lies a heart of gold. 
						When he involuntarily becomes embroiled in an adventure, he discovers not only the importance of friendship, but also 
						that love can appear in the most unusual forms. Shrek undergoes a remarkable development, 
						from a reclusive loner to a hero who finds his true values.</p>

                    <h2>Fiona</h2>
                    <p>	Princess Fiona is a unique character in the fairytale universe. 
						During the day she appears as a classic beauty, but at night she transforms into an ogre. 
						Despite her royal duties, Fiona is an independent and determined woman. 
						Her journey with Shrek leads not only to an unconventional love story, but also to a liberation from societal expectations. 
						Fiona represents the message that true love is based on authenticity and self-acceptance.</p>

                    <h2>Donkey</h2>
                    <p>	Donkey, with his lively personality and quick speech, becomes Shrek's unexpected and loyal companion. 
						His humorous nature not only brings lightness to the story, but also emphasises the importance of diversity and acceptance. 
						Donkey teaches us that friendship knows no boundaries and that even unusual alliances can lead to the strongest bonds. 
						His character is a living example of joie de vivre and positivity.</p>

                    <h2>Lord Farquaad</h2>
                    <p>	Lord Farquaad, the power-hungry ruler with short stature, aspires to become king by marrying Princess Fiona. 
						His character adds a dash of absurdity to the film as his self-centred nature and absurd decisions lead to comical situations. 
						Farquaad's short-sighted ambitions are humorously criticised and he serves as a classic fairytale antagonist with a modern twist.</p>

                    <h2>Dragon</h2>
                    <p>	The dragoness, initially introduced as a threat, develops into an unexpected ally of Shrek and Donkey as the story progresses. 
						Her transformation from a terrifying monster to a symbol of love underlines the film's central message, 
						that prejudice is often deceptive and true beauty lies within. 
						The dragoness represents the idea that everyone, regardless of outward appearances, has the capacity for love and compassion.</p>

                <p>	The film begins with the camera plunging into a fairy tale book that tells the story of a princess who has a terrible, 
					curse that is not specified. She is trapped in a tower and guarded by a fire-breathing dragon, 
					until a brave knight frees her and releases her from the curse with the kiss of true love.
					The hero of the story, Shrek, is an ogre. He is therefore perceived by his contemporaries as big, stupid, ugly and above all dangerous. 
					He lives in a swamp and loves to be alone. When Lord Farquaad, the ruler of the land of "DuLoc", banishes all mythical creatures 
					and relocates them to Shrek's swamp, he makes a deal with the lord: he can have his swamp all to himself again, 
					if he succeeds in freeing the beautiful Princess Fiona from her tower, which is guarded by a dragon. Farquaad secretly promises himself 
					marriage to the princess, which would make him king. Shrek is accompanied on this mission by a talking donkey. 
					Together, the two very different creatures experience various adventures. They manage to free Fiona from the tower 
					and save her from the dragon. Fiona herself is outraged that Lord Farquaad has sent Shrek as a henchman instead of heroically rescuing her himself. 
					On the way back to DuLoc, Shrek has to carry her at first because she refuses to come along. On the way, Shrek and Fiona as well as Donkey 
					and the dragoness fall in love with each other along the way doesn't make the journey any easier. Shrek doesn't realise at this point that Fiona is under a curse, 
					that will turn her into an ogre herself after nightfall. The night before Fiona is to meet Lord Farquaad, Donkey discovers 
					that Fiona turns into an ogre after sunset. Donkey tries to persuade Fiona to stay with Shrek. Shrek hears through the door 
					from the conversation only that Fiona says nobody could love a monster. Shrek thinks that Fiona is talking about him, as he has no way of knowing 
					that Fiona calls herself a monster. Furious, he takes Farquaad to Fiona shortly after sunrise, who has returned to human form. 
					Shrek says goodbye to Fiona, telling her that she is right and that nobody could fall in love with a monster. Fiona, on the other hand, thinks 
					he is talking about her, although he is talking about himself. Unhappy, Fiona decides to marry Farquaad. After donkey Shrek explains the misunderstanding, 
					the two prevent the wedding with the help of the dragon. Farquaad, who wants to execute Shrek and lock Fiona back in the tower, 
					is devoured by the dragon. The subsequent kiss of true love between Fiona and Shrek lifts the curse on Fiona. 
					She finally takes on the form of an ogre woman and marries Shrek. </p>
